Computational linguistics, also known as natural language processing, encompasses three distinct areas of study: (1)
human language technologies, such as machine translation, information extraction, or spoken language dialogue systems;
(2) computational models of language users, either human (computational psycholinguistics) or artifactual (artificial
intelligence); and (3) digital linguistics, which is the use of computation in support of language documentation and linguistic
research. For all three areas of study, there is a common body of fundamentals. This class introduces those fundamentals.
One focus is the processing pipeline involved in natural language understanding, particularly part of speech tagging,
parsing, and semantic interpretation. A second focus is the extraction of linguistic information from text corpora; we will touch
on collocations, language models, regular expressions, and text classification. The approach will be very hands-on. We will
use the Natural Language Toolkit, in the Python programming language. The course does not assume prior experience with
Python, nor does it assume a computer science background. It is particularly intended for language, linguistics, psychology,
and cognitive science students. However, prior programming experience is absolutely essential - this course is not an
introduction to programming.

_(4; 3 in the half-term). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
Sports are a seemingly universal feature of societies across the world. From soccer to cricket, from baseball to the Olympic
Games, sports constitute connections across space and time. This course examines the reach of sports with attention to
scale and theory. We'll look at the following questions over the term: What can turning our attention to different contexts and
different times tell us about the purpose and development of sports? How can sports shed light on constructions of gender,
sexuality, and race? What are the links between sports and political power, state building, social protest, and globalization?
What separates sports today from athletics in the premodern world? This course will approach the above through different
problem-based modules, which will introduce students to the theoretical underpinnings of world history.

historians inaugurated the twentieth century and the era we are still living in. We will approach the history of this conflict from
many perspectives. We will not only rely on the tools of military and political history, but also on those of literary criticism, art
and music history, and historical ethnography, to investigate how ordinary people, on and off the fronts, made sense of what
in retrospect seem like impossible challenges and traumas. We will look at the ways the war was experienced, debated, and
remembered in a variety of different social and geographical contexts, from the European capitals to the increasingly
restless colonial world.

**HISTORY 265 / PSYCH 265 / STS 265. Minds and Brains in America**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This course surveys the science and medicine of mind and brain in the United States. It reviews major developments in
psychology, psychiatry, cognitive science, and neurology, along with efforts to apply these in non-scientific arenas. We begin
early in the 1800s with asylums, phrenology, and other efforts to address madness. Later in the century, we see the rise of
scientific professions against the backdrop of evolutionary theory. Entering the twentieth century, we track how new theories
of mind affected public life. The final unit brings these topics and themes up to the present day. Our authors are both
famous-including Darwin, Freud, Skinner, and Pinker-and lesser known. This course is meant to provide historical
background for further work in mind and brain science. As an introductory humanities course, we also discuss the practice of
writing and the mechanisms of historical argument. We read literary fiction in addition to scientific papers, further
supplemented by frequent use of (mostly recent) films in lectures.


**HISTORY 266. Twentieth-Century American Wars as Social and Personal Experience**
_(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This course will examine the American experience of war. Lectures, readings, films, and discussions will focus not only on
the military experience itself, but on how America's wars, real and imagined; have shaped the country's economy, politics,
and culture. The course will also examine the processes of transmission and memory: how Americans who did not fight
learned about those who did, and what all Americans have remembered or have been taught to remember about the wars of
this century. Finally, we will consider how the nation's wartime conduct, at home and on the battlefield, has fit into long-
standing social patterns and behavior such as our alleged propensity for violence. In brief, we will be looking at the American
experience of war as inclusively as a term will allow.

_(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This is a course about women's lives during approximately 1,000 years of history (c. 600 BCE - 400 CE). Our focus will be
the multicultural world of the Roman Empire, which, at its height, encompassed the entire Mediterranean region. We will

**HISTORY 322 / GERMAN 322 / JUDAIC 322. The Origins of Nazism**
_(4). (HU). (R&E). May not be repeated for credit. Taught in English._
This course explores the origins and the outcomes of the Nazi seizure of power in German in 1933. Because no single
factor can explain why Germans consented to Nazi rule of why so few resisted Nazi persecution and genocide, we will take
multi-layered approach to this question, examining the relationships among the between political, cultural, and social, and
economic change. First exploring the vibrant culture and fractured politics of the Weimar Republic in which the Nazis rose to
power, we will then analyze the ideologies and practices of the Nazi "racial state" and the forces that drove it into war and
genocide. Students will also examine the blurry lines between consent and dissent, complicity and resistance in the
everyday lives of both perpetrators and victims of the regime. Team-taught by two professors from History and German,
course materials will include not only historical texts, but also film, art, literature, and personal memoirs from the Weimar and
Nazi periods.

_(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This course examines the history of Italy from 1815 to the present. Modern Italy has been a laboratory for the social and
political change of western Europe. Nationalism, fascism, and social democracy have found Italy an ideal terrain for their
conceptual and historical development. We will focus on national unification post-unification strategies and contradictory
nature of Italian democracy in post W.W.II decades.


**HISTORY 327 / WGS 327. The History of Sexuality**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
Does sex have a history? This course proposed to respond to this provocative question by demonstrating how modern
notions of sexuality have emerged historically. In that sense, sex is not part of nature, it is part of culture, or rather cultures
and their histories. This lecture course will introduce students to an exciting new field of historical research. Our approach
will be both topical and chronological; from ancient times to the present.

_(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._

past notions about sex in the United States.

**HISTORY 361. Culture Wars are Nothing New: U.S. Intellectual History, 1750-1940**
_(3 - 4). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
Worries about "culture wars" seem to be everywhere in contemporary America. And yet, as we discover in this lecture
course, fighting over the nature of the nation, over what values to espouse and how to put them into operation is as old as
the republic itself. In order to understand the current wars over what America should stand for, what democracy can and
should be, and who should be counted as part of the citizenry, then we need to explore their historical roots and to see the
many possibilities that have been advanced and fought over.

**HISTORY 363. The History of Modern Mexico, 1810-Present**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This course examines the history of modern Mexico, from the end of colonialism to the recent war on drugs. In 1821,
Mexicans declared independence from Spain. But what did it mean, socially, culturally, and politically to be a Mexican
nation? At the dawn of nationhood and through the rest of the twentieth century, Mexico's polity remained profoundly divided
along racial, cultural, class, and ideological lines. Our course probes the sources of these divisions and their implications for
the development of a national identity. We will immerse ourselves in the changing world of Mexican women, men,
indigenous peoples, immigrants, and other groups, using lectures and assignments that draw on an array of historical
documents, from state decrees, letters, murals, folk songs, to religious images.


**HISTORY 373 / AMCULT 373 / LATINOAM 373 / NATIVEAM 373. History of the U.S. West**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
This course examines both the "place" and the "process" of the history of the U.S. West, a shifting region of the Native North
America that was the object first of Spanish, French, and English imperial designs, then of U.S. expansionism, and finally a
region with peculiarities to the federal government, distinctive patterns of race relations, and a unique place in American
cultural memory.

**HISTORY 375 / WGS 375. A History of Witchcraft: The 1692 Salem Trials in Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective**
_(4). (HU). May not be repeated for credit._
In 1692, the notorious witchcraft trials took place in Salem, Massachusetts. While this case would become America's most
famous witchcraft episode, it drew on a long history of witchcraft belief, accusation, and prosecution in Europe and the New
World. In order to understand Salem and the phenomenon of witchcraft more generally, this course explores the long
context of European witchcraft belief through the present day.

**HISTORY 377 / AMCULT 315 / LATINOAM 315. Latino/a/e History as U.S. History**
_(3 - 4). (HU). (R&E). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in
AMCULT 312 or HISTORY 312._
This course centers the major groups commonly classified as "Latino/a/e" States as critical to understanding the United
States' history from 1820 to the present. Particular attention will be given to the major populations (Mexican/Mexican
American, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban/Cuban Americans), but the course will also include discussion of other groups that are
gaining prominence, such as Central Americans. To organize the class, we start by questioning the creation and meaning of
a racialized "pan-Latino" identity in the United States. Ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and nation have been important in
the shaping of modern assumptions about Latina/o/e identity. We consider how different groups have historically understood
these ideas and their relationships to other Americans and other Latino groups.

_A knowledge of Russian is not required. (3). (HU). (R&E). May not be repeated for credit. Taught in English._
During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the former
Yugoslavia were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political
topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in
patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were often able to be more incisive, frank and provocative than is
often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers crafted powerful films which the regimes
had no ideological grounds to suppress; this tradition of critical filmmaking has continued into the post-Communist period.
The films we study concern the Holocaust, women's lives under state socialism, and the ethno-nationalism that led to the
wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. We view and discuss fourteen films from East Central Europe dealing with the
above issues, considering the artistic structure of the films as well.

instruments. Particular attention is given to international law (for example, the Geneva Conventions), intergovernmental
organizations (e.g. League of Nations and the United Nations), and institutions charged with prosecuting human rights
violations (such as the International Criminal Tribunal on Yugoslavia). In analyzing the development of legal and normative

**HISTORY 305 / PSYCH 321 / STS 305. American Addictions**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (ID). May not be repeated for credit._
Our subject is addiction. What is it? Why does it matter? This course explores how certain kinds of behavior (and people)
have been studied, understood, and treated under the rubric of "addiction" in the United States. We will focus on how
theories of addiction and its treatment have embodied different views of personhood, agency, and ethics. One aim of the
course is to combine humanistic and scientific ways of thinking, including through individual and collaborative writing
projects that bring past and present understandings of addictive substances and behaviors into conversation. This approach
is essential to grappling with the political, philosophical, and personal consequences of how we study and stigmatize
particular ways of life. Our focus on crucial texts in the history of science and medicine means that we will engage with
technical material from psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, while our approach to this work will draw on methods from
across the humanities. Given recent and ongoing events surrounding opioid use and dependency as well as the
intersections of race, gender, and class with addiction and its treatment, we will consistently return to the uses of history in
the present.

Islam a force to be reckoned with globally. Thirty years later, the custodians of the Islamic Republic have had to contend with
a civil rights movement (the Green Movement of 2009) that demanded a government characterized by voting rights, gender
equality, and freedom of assembly and of expression. This course will explore 40 years of revolutionary change in Iran
through public spaces where popular social and political visions were articulated and shaped. In this course we will employ
ethnographic studies of daily life in the capital city of Tehran to explore piety, sexuality, the occult and politics in modern Iran.
Using the media of cinema, blogs, painting, and photography, we will investigate both the challenges Iranians have faced in
a radically changed society as well as the language of resistance with which they have experimented.

**AAS 304 / WGS 304. Gender and Immigration: Identity, Race, and Place**
_The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome. (3). (SS). May not be

Refugees, migrants, immigrants, diaspora groups, and transnational actors are all terms that describe people who undertake
different acts of mobility or travel across borders. But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various
acts of mobility (travel) to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We
examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border crossing, and
displacement in this significant age of globalization, transnational mobility, and search of refuge. We will examine the
meanings of travel and border crossing in relation to popular concepts such as "refugee-ness", "diaspora," and
"transnationalism." Have the meanings of these terms been useful in understanding the social constructions of gender
identities, race, ethnicity, xenophobia, and even health and reproduction? We will particularly explore how questions of
power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants' daily struggles for justice and demands of inclusion in
the rubrics of both national and transnational imagined communities. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and
"imagine" their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? And how their imaginations are
interrupted by complex socio-economic and political realities? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and
theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, literature, and political science. And we
will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, the
Middle East Asia, and Latin America.

Capitalism**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (SS). May not be repeated for credit._
Built around the lives of the richest, most influential business men and women in the history of Europe and the United
States, How to Become a Billionaire examines the complicated roles played by business tycoons in developing Western
capitalism - from Marcus Crassus in Ancient Rome to Mark Zuckerberg in Silicon Valley. What did "doing business" consist
of, and how did it change over the course of this period? What factors led to wealth and dominance, or bankruptcy and
insignificance in the business world? What was the influence of business leaders - both positive and negative - on their
economy, society, and state? Attention will be paid to individual ability, ambition, and leadership, as well as larger
opportunities for, constraints on, and contours of entrepreneurship, innovation, and success. By blending business history
and biography and analyzing motives, strategies, activities and impacts, the course examines the subject historically as a
way of contextualizing and understanding current possibilities and challenges that shape a successful business career.
Sectors being highlighted include: banking, trading, retailing, manufacturing, investing and technology. The course analyzes
the careers of men and women who acquired "billions" by virtue of entrepreneurial intelligence and opportunity - not by birth,
marriage, or territorial conquest. Families and individuals studied include: the de Medicis, the Fuggers, the Rothschilds,
Josiah Wedgwood, John Jacob Astor, John D. Rockefeller, Sr., J.P. Morgan, Elizabeth Arden, Estee Lauder, Sam Walton,
George Soros, Oprah Winfrey, Robert Johnson, Meg Whitman, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Holmes, and Mark Zuckerberg.

**HISTORY 282. A History of the Economy**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (SS). May not be repeated for credit._

not only the diplomatic and military events that may come most readily to mind when one thinks about "foreign relations," but
also the economic, religious, social, and cultural realms that have shaped Americans' experiences in the world. The course
internationalizes events in U.S. history that are conventionally understood in domestic terms (e.g., the Civil War,
immigration), and foregrounds the voices of those who have been marginalized in the study of U.S. foreign relations,
especially women, people of color, and indigenous people. Students analyze scholarly texts as well as historical documents
to situate current events in historical context.

The transformation of China in our era marks a milestone in global history. During the past century, the onetime "sick man of
Asia" has become the "factory of the world," rising as a great power, with its own geopolitical ambitions. Spanning the White
Lotus Rebellion in the late eighteenth century through the first decades of the twenty-first, this course traces how war,
insurrection, and revolution transformed China. The subject matter of the course is arranged chronologically, but with
reference to different time periods, as they exemplify different themes in Chinese history. The course draws on selected
readings from secondary sources, as well as fiction and primary sources in translation. Students who complete the course
will be able to adduce supporting evidence from course readings as they identify and explain the significance and relevance
of major figures, terms, events and institutions in Chinese history from 1790 to 2010. These students will have acquired a
nuanced and critical understanding of continuity and rupture in the transformation in China, focusing on the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. No prior knowledge of China or any Chinese language is required.

**HISTORY 366. Crime and Drugs in Modern America**
_(4; 3 in the half-term). (SS). May not be repeated for credit._
This course explores the various government wars on crime and drugs in the United States during the twentieth century,
from alcohol prohibition through the crack cocaine and opioid "epidemics," from anti-vice crusades in the Progressive Era
through the recent rise of mass incarceration under what critics label the American prison-industrial complex. The U.S.
currently incarcerates around 2.3 million people, a higher percentage than any other nation in the world; counting probation
and parole, more than 7 million Americans live under the supervision of the criminal justice system. At least 24 million
Americans violate drug prohibition laws each month, primarily by smoking marijuana or the illicit use of pharmaceuticals; of
the half million people imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses, two-thirds are African American or Latino. This course will
examine the deep historical roots of this contemporary landscape, especially the fuzzy and shifting boundaries between
legality and illegality and the ways in which race, class, gender, and urban/suburban space have shaped policing practices,
criminal justice enforcement, and media representations of criminality. Topics range from Mafia syndicates and Mexican
cartels to the FBI and Big Pharma, from "stop and frisk" policing to the "just say no" campaign against teenage pot smoking,
from immigration controls to the criminalization of political dissent, from crusades against juvenile delinquency to panics over
kidnappers and sex offenders, from Attica and the prisoners' rights movement to racial controversies such as the Rockefeller
Drug Laws, Central Park Five, and Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson.

the literature of the Holocaust.

**HISTORY 389 / ARMENIAN 389 / MIDEAST 389. From Natives to Foreigners: Armenians in Turkey and the Diaspora**
_(3). (SS). (R&E). May not be repeated for credit._
With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Armenian genocide 'survivors' became citizens of an ethno-
religious nation-state that once sought their annihilation. We read the history of the Republic of Turkey parallel with the
Armenian experience to look at the ambiguous relationship Armenians continue to have with the Turkish state following the
Lausanne Treaty of 1923, the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul, as well as the Armenian diaspora institutions. The readings
will contrast official and critical historiographical accounts of republican Turkey and modern Armenians, as well as silenced
chapters, absences, and misrepresentation of Armenians in such accounts by looking at ethnographies and social historical
accounts.
